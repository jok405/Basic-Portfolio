        <p>
          English was not my first language. Food was my first language.
          I love to cook. I love playing sports. I love being outside.

          I am trying to stay positive while drinking from a fire hose. Adding to that chugging is not my forte. I have spend more than ten hours on this assignment. My dog has forgotten who I am because I talk to Victor, my rubber ducky.

          Idiosyncrasies:
          I think in Korean before I speak English. Now I am learning to code - what could possibly go wrong?
